## Introduction

Google Ads incorporates a recommendation system. While not a traditional recommendation system like those used in e-commerce or streaming services, Google Ads uses advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to recommend advertising strategies, keywords, and bidding options to advertisers. Each recommendation provides customized suggestions to help improve your campaign's performance.

This dynamic recommendation system tailors advertising strategies for businesses by leveraging machine learning, user behavior data, and automated bidding. It plays a critical role in driving both seller and customer engagement by suggesting keywords, ad targeting, and bidding strategies.

## Scenario Design

**Who are the target Users?**

The target users for Google Ads include a wide range of individuals and organizations looking to promote products, services, or content through paid advertising on Google's platforms.

**What are their goals? **

As an advertiser, the main goals are to:

  - Increase sales: Drive more traffic and conversions.
  
  - Promote their brand: Build brand awareness and visibility.
  
  - Acquire new customers: Attract new leads and customers.
  
  - Manage multiple campaigns: Track and optimize different ad campaigns simultaneously

**How can you help them accomplish those goals?**

Google Ads helps its target users accomplish their goals by offering a range of features, tools, and strategies tailored to different business needs.


### For the Organization

This scenario refers to the advertiser who has the objective of improving the ad campaign by optimizing ad targeting, bidding strategies, and keywords.
  
  - Ad Targeting Recommendations:
     Google Ads recommends strategies to help businesses target specific audiences based on factors such as location, browsing behavior, and purchase history.
  
  - Smart Bidding:
    Automated biding strategies recommendations, this allows advertisers to optimize bids and ensure that their ads are shown at the right time to the right audience.
    Google Ads can suggest bidding strategies like cost-per-click (CPC) or cost-per-acquisition (CPA)
  
  - Keyword Recommendations:
    High-conversion keywords that are relevant to the products or services being advertised.

Organizations can implement A/B testing based on Google Ads’ recommendations to identify which targeting strategies and keyword choices lead to higher engagement and sales.

    Ads are shown based on the user’s browsing history, search queries, and demographic information
